#  Chinu Tier 1 prework project
## BrandynCO.github.io

## Description
This project was based on the [Tier 1 Website Template](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/soloproject-tier1-website-template). The goal of the project was to clone the website. Within this code, I was able to mostly reproduce the desired clone. 

## Features

###  Images
The background and content images were from Unsplash. Icon was from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)

### CSS
#### Grid
Most of the content on the website uses a grid format. The contact section uses the Grid area function to map out the areas for the different sections.

### Javascript
#### Smooth Scrolling
Click the menu buttons will allow you to seemlessly scroll to the next sections with ease.
